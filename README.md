# Naval Fight

Naval Fight is a turn based game. It is a two player game in which both players are given 5 ships of varying size that they need to place on their grid. The other opposing player doesn't know where the friendly ships are placed. The objective of the game is to strategically guess where the opposing player has place their ships and whoever sinks the other person's ships first, wins.

## About This Game

This game is written using Java and Java Swing. Instead of a two player approach, a simple AI is used to play against one player. The player is given 5 ships that each have a unique size. The ships take up, 5, 4, 3, 3, and 2 grid spaces respectively. Once the player has chosen the ship locations, the game can begin. The computer chooses its ship's locations and is given the first turn. From here, both players keep making turns until all the ships of one of the players has been sunk.
